# üì± App Usage Analysis Through Machine Learning

This project analyzes user interaction time with a mobile application and identifies quitting reasons through advanced analytics. The goal is to derive insights and recommend **pricing** and **retention strategies** to enhance user engagement and revenue.

---

## üß† Problem Statement and Approach

We analyzed a dataset of **10,000 customer records** with the following key features:
- Number of days the app was used
- Total minutes spent on the app
- Churn reasons (categorized into four types)
- Pricing tiers offered to customers

To derive actionable insights:
- **Classification models** (Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression) were trained, achieving approximately **67% accuracy**.
- **K-Means Clustering** segmented users based on usage and behavioral patterns.
- **Visualizations** highlighted usage trends, churn drivers, and pricing sensitivity.

## üîÑ Update: Dynamic Pricing Prediction

An additional module predicts the **highest price** a customer is likely to accept at two predefined probability thresholds.

- If the model doesn‚Äôt meet the confidence level for any price tier, it defaults to recommending either the **original** or the **minimum offered price**.

## üìä Key Visualizations

A folder named `Images` contains all essential visualizations related to user behavior, churn analysis, and pricing impact.
